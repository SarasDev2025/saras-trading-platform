## üìã TODO Items

### üî¥ Critical - Must Complete

- [ ] Generate tax reporting data
- [ ] Store tax details in `user_dividend_payments`
- **Location**: `api-gateway/services/dividend_service.py`

#### 4. **Real Broker Integration for DRIP**
- [ ] Integrate Alpaca market buy orders for DRIP
- [ ] Integrate Zerodha orders for DRIP (India)
- [ ] Handle broker-specific order types
- [ ] Store broker transaction IDs
- **Location**: `api-gateway/services/dividend_scheduler.py`

### üü° Important - Incomplete Features

#### 5. **Error Handling & Recovery**
- [ ] Handle partial order execution failures
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed broker calls
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms for failed bulk orders
- [ ] Alert admins on critical failures
- **Location**: Throughout dividend services

#### 6. **Transaction Safety**
- [ ] Implement distributed transaction patterns
- [ ] Ensure atomicity of share distribution
- [ ] Handle concurrent dividend processing
- [ ] Add database transaction isolation
- **Location**: `api-gateway/services/dividend_service.py`

#### 7. **Notification System**
- [ ] Send dividend announcement notifications
- [ ] Alert users about DRIP execution
- [ ] Notify about payment receipt
- [ ] Email/SMS integration
- **Location**: New service or integrate with existing notification service

#### 8. **Admin Dashboard**
- [ ] Create UI for monitoring bulk orders
- [ ] Display dividend processing status
- [ ] Show aggregation statistics
- [ ] Manual intervention controls
- **Location**: `web-ui/client/src/pages/` (new page needed)

### üü¢ Enhancement - Future Features

#### 9. **Multi-Currency Support**
- [ ] Handle dividends in different currencies
- [ ] Currency conversion logic
- [ ] Exchange rate tracking
- [ ] Multi-currency payment support
- **Status**: Currently USD-centric

#### 10. **Stock Dividends**
- [ ] Implement stock dividend logic (not just cash)
- [ ] Share issuance tracking
- [ ] Fractional share handling for stock dividends
- **Status**: Only cash dividends implemented

#### 11. **Special Dividends**
- [ ] Support one-time special dividend handling
- [ ] Distinguish from regular dividends in reporting
- [ ] Tax treatment differences
- **Status**: Basic support exists, needs refinement

#### 12. **Historical Reporting**
- [ ] Generate dividend income reports
- [ ] Tax year summaries
- [ ] Export to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Integration with tax software
- **Location**: New reporting service needed

## üöÄ Quick Start for Development

### Test Dividend Flow Locally
```bash
# 1. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Create test dividend declaration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/dividends/declarations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "asset_id": "...",
    "ex_dividend_date": "2025-11-01",
    "record_date": "2025-11-02",
    "payment_date": "2025-11-15",
    "dividend_amount": "0.50"
  }'

# 3. Check scheduler status
curl http://localhost:8000/dividends/scheduler/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Key Files to Modify
- **Bulk Order Execution**: `api-gateway/services/dividend_scheduler.py` (line ~150-200)
- **Share Distribution**: `api-gateway/services/dividend_service.py` (add new method)
- **Broker Integration**: `api-gateway/services/dividend_scheduler.py` (integrate with `BrokerConnectionService`)
- **Admin Dashboard**: `web-ui/client/src/pages/dividends-admin.tsx` (create new)

## üìù Notes & Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **Execution Window**: Hard-coded to 1 hour before market open - needs configuration
2. **Broker Selection**: Uses `BrokerSelectionService` but needs optimization for bulk
3. **Fractional Shares**: Alpaca supports, Zerodha doesn't - needs handling
4. **Market Hours**: Currently doesn't check if market is open
5. **Order Aggregation**: Aggregates by asset+broker, could optimize further

### Production Deployment Considerations
- **Database**: Ensure proper indexing on `dividend_declarations.payment_date`
- **Scheduler**: Run as singleton (use leader election in K8s)
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for failed bulk orders
- **Backup**: Regular snapshots of dividend tables
- **Load Testing**: Test with 1000+ concurrent users receiving dividends
